## Reporting a Vulnerability

For disclosing vulnerabilities please send a private message `@cached-data.bsky.social`.

Please include as much information as possible while disclosing a vulnerability through the Bluesky DM.

Please be responsible while disclosing a vulnerability.

Messages will be checked once every two weeks. 

If the vulnerability is accepted, a fix will be worked on. 

During the patch release, the security researcher who submitted the original disclosure will be credited through a post on LinkedIn.

If you don't hear back even after 4 weeks, it means that the vulnerability submission was rejected. 

Please don't hesitate to send in a new submission if you find a different vulnerability in the future, but please don't send duplicates/ resubmit the rejected vulnerability.

**Thank you so much for keeping the internet safe for everyone.**
