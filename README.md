## Social Text Formatter
This is a simple text formatter that makes your social media posts look pretty by enabling bold and italics texts. It uses a `Unicode Substituion` technique to workaround the rendering limitations of such texts on social media platforms.

>[!TIP]
> The app also uses an EdgeAI (Gemini-nano on Chrome) for a feature that allows you to detect the overall perceived sentiment of your post content. To use this feature you'll need to enable the `experimental` gemini nano prompting flag in you Chrome browser settings.
